# FAQ

## What is MesaLogo?

MesaLogo is an innovative platform that integrates large language models with traditional agent-based modeling, focusing on simulating dialogue-based agent interactions. Through its dual-engine rule system, supervisor mechanism, and multi-agent collaboration framework, it provides intelligent solutions for complex multi-party collaborative decision-making.

## How is MesaLogo different from traditional ABM software?

Traditional ABM software (such as NetLogo, Mesa, AnyLogic) mainly focuses on spatial movement and state changes, requiring programming skills to define rules. MesaLogo centers on dialogue and communication, supports natural language rule definitions, has built-in automated supervision mechanisms, and is suitable for both technical and non-technical users.

Key differences:
- **Rule Definition**: MesaLogo supports dual-engine with natural language rules + programmatic logic rules
- **User Threshold**: Suitable for users with both technical and non-technical backgrounds
- **Supervision Mechanism**: Built-in automated supervisor role
- **Interaction Focus**: Centered on dialogue and communication

## How is MesaLogo different from modern LLM platforms?

Modern LLM platforms (such as Dify, Langflow, RAGFlow) mainly target single agents or simple multi-turn dialogues, focusing on knowledge retrieval and workflow automation. MesaLogo focuses on complex multi-party interaction scenarios.

Key differences:
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Built-in multi-role collaboration framework
- **Rule System**: Dual-engine hybrid rule system
- **Environment Variables**: Complete environment variable architecture
- **Application Focus**: Complex multi-party interaction scenarios

## How does the dual-engine rule system work?

The dual-engine rule system combines natural language rule engine and logic rule engine:

- **Natural Language Engine**: Handles complex semantic understanding and dialogue logic
- **Logic Rule Engine**: Handles precise calculations and conditional judgments

The two engines work together to ensure both system flexibility and execution accuracy.

## What application scenarios does MesaLogo support?

MesaLogo supports various application scenarios, including:

- Supply chain simulation
- Red-Blue team exercises
- Mock court
- Software development collaboration
- Expert consultation
- Business negotiation
- Enterprise decision-making and management
- Medical consultation
- Education and training
- Policy analysis
- R&D innovation
- Intelligent system control

Any complex scenario requiring multi-party collaborative decision-making and dialogue interaction can be modeled and simulated through MesaLogo.

## How do I get started with MesaLogo?

You can get started with MesaLogo in the following ways:

1. Visit the GitHub repository to get the source code
2. Review the technical documentation to understand the system architecture
3. Run example scenarios to experience the features
4. Contact our team for technical support and customization services

For detailed installation steps, please refer to the [Quick Start](/docs/intro) documentation.

## What technical background is required for MesaLogo?

MesaLogo is designed for users with different technical backgrounds:

- **Non-technical users**: Can define rules and scenarios through natural language
- **Technical users**: Can deeply customize logic rules and system integration

Basic computer operation skills are sufficient to get started, while advanced features may require some programming knowledge.

## How does the supervisor mechanism ensure simulation quality?

The supervisor mechanism ensures simulation quality through:

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitors agent behavior, rule execution, and dialogue quality
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automatically detects abnormal behavior
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback
- **Process Adjustment**: Adjusts dialogue flow
- **Necessary Intervention**: Intervenes when necessary

This ensures the rationality of the simulation process and the reliability of results.

## Does MesaLogo support integration with external systems?

Yes, MesaLogo supports integration with external systems through the MCP (Model-Control-Protocol) plugin system.

Supported integration types:
- Real business systems
- Databases
- API services
- Smart devices
- File systems

This allows agents to extend simulations to actual action domains, enabling more realistic and valuable application scenarios.

## What large language models does MesaLogo support?

MesaLogo supports various large language models and platforms:

- OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc.)
- Anthropic Claude
- Google Gemini
- Chinese LLMs (Qwen, ERNIE Bot, etc.)
- Custom API interfaces

Also compatible with external agent platforms:
- Dify
- FastGPT
- Coze
- Other platforms compatible with OpenAI API
